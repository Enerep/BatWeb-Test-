			Hello! My name is Bat-Ochir.
			I was born in 20th of June, 2003.
			I want to become an programmer because it's really interesting to me.
			I learned coding when I was 14 years old. My first programming language that I learned was C++, and it was really exciting! I made my own small projects in C++, and now I'm doing my first website by only HTML, CSS, and JS.
			I know C++, Python, SQL, C, Ruby, JavaScript, TypeScript, and etc. 
		</p>
		<p class="InfoP2"> 
			You can see my certificates and projects on SoloLearn or on GitHub! Feel free
